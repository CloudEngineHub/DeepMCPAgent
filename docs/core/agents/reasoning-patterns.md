# Reasoning Patterns

Every Promptise agent is powered by a Reasoning Graph. By default, `build_agent()` creates a ReAct graph (single node with tools) — and that default is **smart by default**: it manages context automatically (`context_scope="auto"`), so simple tasks are unchanged and deep tool loops stay token-efficient without you choosing anything.

!!! tip "Which one do I need? (most people: none)"
    - **Just call `build_agent(model, servers)`** — the default handles context and tools well for the overwhelming majority of agents.
    - **Computing over data** (sums, averages, multi-hop joins)? → [`code-action`](#code-action) — write one program instead of chaining tool calls.
    - **Want a cheap self-check** on a weak/cheap model? → [`verify`](#verify).
    - **Need a specific multi-stage shape** (debate, research pipeline, deep deliberation)? → the structured patterns below, or [build your own graph](#building-custom-graphs).

    The rest are specialized. Don't reach for a multi-stage pattern expecting more accuracy — on capable models they mostly add latency and tokens; the default plus `code-action` is the efficient path.

You can replace the default with any of the 10 built-in patterns, or build your own.

```

The Reasoning Graph replaces only the inner loop. All other features (memory, guardrails, cache, observability, events, approval, streaming) stay the same regardless of pattern.

## Quick Reference

```python
from promptise import build_agent

# Default — single node with tools
agent = await build_agent(model="openai:gpt-5-mini", servers=my_servers)

# Built-in patterns
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="react")       # Tool-calling loop
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="verify")      # Plan → Solve → Self-check (1 turn)
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="managed")     # Tool loop with facts-ledger context
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="code-action") # Writes ONE sandboxed program (1 turn)
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="peoatr")      # Plan → Act → Think → Reflect
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="research")    # Search → Verify → Synthesize
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="autonomous")  # Agent builds own path
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="deliberate")  # Think → Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="debate")      # Proposer ↔ Critic → Judge
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern="pipeline")    # Sequential chain

# Custom graph
agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern=my_graph)

# Node pool (autonomous mode)
agent = await build_agent(..., node_pool=[PlanNode("plan", is_entry=True), ...])
```

## Built-in Patterns

### ReAct (Default)

Single PromptNode with tools. The LLM decides when to call tools and when to produce a final answer. Simplest and fastest for most use cases.

```
reason ──→ (tool calls) ──→ reason ──→ ... ──→ final answer
```

**Best for:** Simple tool-calling agents, Q&A, most general tasks.

### Verify

A single PromptNode, but the model must **plan, solve, and check its own answer
within one generation** — the benefit of an explicit verification step at
one-turn latency (no extra LLM calls). The node prompt forces a `PLAN → SOLVE →
VERIFY → final answer` structure where the VERIFY step independently re-checks
the answer a different way and fixes it if wrong.

```
reason (PLAN → SOLVE → VERIFY → answer)  [single turn]
```

**Best for:** Arithmetic/logic-heavy questions, anything where a quick
self-check catches careless errors — without paying for a multi-stage pipeline.

!!! note "Honest scope"
    On strong models that already reason internally, `verify` matches a direct
    prompt; its measurable gains show up on weaker/cheaper models where the
    forced self-check recovers errors a single pass would miss. See the
    [Verify prebuilt](../engine-prebuilts.md#verify-single-pass-self-checking).

### Managed

A single tool-using node run with `context_scope="ledger"` for **long tool
chains**. Instead of feeding the model an ever-growing transcript of tool calls
and results — where it loses track and re-queries the same facts repeatedly —
each turn it sees the task plus a compact, **deduplicated "facts gathered"
ledger**. Context stays bounded and identical `(tool, args)` calls are served
from cache instead of re-executed.

```
reason ──→ (tool) ──→ reason + facts-ledger ──→ (tool) ──→ ... ──→ answer
```

**Best for:** Deep multi-tool tasks — traversing a database/graph, gathering
many facts then aggregating.

!!! note "Honest scope"
    `managed` is an **efficiency primitive**: on long tool chains it cuts
    redundant tool calls and bounds token growth at **equal** accuracy — it does
    not by itself make the model answer more correctly. See
    [Context scope](../engine-nodes.md#context-scope) for the mechanism.

### Code-Action

For **aggregation / data-traversal tasks** — gather many facts, then compute —
the model writes **one Python program** over your tools in a single LLM turn,
instead of chaining dozens of conversational tool calls. The program runs in
Promptise's hardened Docker sandbox; its tool calls bridge back to the real host
tools, so the model gets code's exactness (loops, sums, filters) while each tool
keeps its protections — approval gates, plus budget/health/audit hooks when the
Agent Runtime has attached them, and a hard per-run `max_tool_calls` cap.

```
reason → write ONE program → run in sandbox (tools bridged to host) → answer
```

```python
agent = await build_agent(
    servers=my_servers,            # or extra_tools=[...]
    model="openai:gpt-5-mini",
    agent_pattern="code-action",   # sandbox auto-enabled (Docker required)
)
```

**Best for:** computing over a dataset/graph — sums, averages, multi-hop joins —
especially where a conversational loop would re-query facts and mis-aggregate.

!!! warning "Requirements & scope"
    Requires **Docker** (the program runs in a sandbox; auto-enabled). It shines
    when your tools return **structured data** (lists/dicts/numbers) the program
    can use directly. It is a *pattern, not a replacement* — ambiguous or
    conversational tasks are better served by `react`/`managed`. The sandbox has
    a read-only rootfs, dropped capabilities, and **no network** — the program
    reaches the outside world only through your bridged tools.

### PEOATR

Four specialized stages: Plan subgoals → Act with tools → Think about results → Reflect on progress. The reflect stage decides whether to continue, replan, or answer.

```
plan ──→ act ──→ think ──→ reflect ──→ (continue/replan/answer)
```

**Best for:** Complex multi-step tasks, research, tasks requiring self-correction.

### Research

Three-stage pipeline: Search gathers information, Verify cross-checks for accuracy, Synthesize produces the final output. Verification loops back to search if quality is low.

```
search ──→ verify ──→ synthesize
              ↓ (fail)
           search
```

**Best for:** Fact-checking, research reports, tasks requiring verified information.

### Autonomous

The agent receives a pool of reasoning nodes and dynamically decides which to execute at each step. No static edges — the LLM builds its own execution path.

```
[think, plan, search, analyze, synthesize] → Agent chooses → Agent chooses → ...
```

**Best for:** Open-ended tasks, exploration, tasks where the optimal reasoning path isn't known ahead of time.

### Deliberate

Five-stage deep reasoning: Think before acting, plan the approach, act with tools, observe results carefully, then reflect. Slower but produces higher-quality results.

```
think ──→ plan ──→ act ──→ observe ──→ reflect ──→ (continue/replan/answer)
```

**Best for:** High-stakes decisions, complex analysis, tasks where accuracy matters more than speed.

### Debate

Adversarial two-agent debate. A proposer generates an answer, a critic challenges it, and they alternate until a judge renders the final verdict.

```
proposer ──→ critic ──→ (severity high) ──→ proposer
                    ──→ (severity low)  ──→ judge ──→ done
```

**Best for:** Controversial topics, decision-making, generating robust arguments.

### Pipeline

Simple sequential chain. Each node runs once in order. No loops, no conditions. Use when you need a fixed sequence of processing steps.

```
step1 ──→ step2 ──→ step3 ──→ done
```

**Best for:** Data processing, ETL, fixed multi-step workflows.

## Building Custom Graphs

### With Reasoning Nodes

Pre-built building bricks — fully configured with instructions, context management, and default flags:

```python
from promptise import build_agent
from promptise.engine import PromptGraph, PromptNode
from promptise.engine.reasoning_nodes import (
    PlanNode, ThinkNode, ReflectNode, SynthesizeNode,
)

graph = PromptGraph("my-agent", nodes=[
    PlanNode("plan", is_entry=True),
    PromptNode("act", inject_tools=True),
    ThinkNode("think"),
    ReflectNode("reflect"),
    SynthesizeNode("answer", is_terminal=True),
])

agent = await build_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-mini",
    servers=my_servers,
    agent_pattern=graph,
)
```

In autonomous mode (default), the agent decides which node to execute next. No edges needed.

### With Static Edges

Wire nodes explicitly for a fixed topology:

```python
graph = PromptGraph("pipeline", mode="static")

graph.add_node(PlanNode("plan"))
graph.add_node(PromptNode("execute", inject_tools=True))
graph.add_node(SynthesizeNode("answer"))

graph.sequential("plan", "execute", "answer")
graph.set_entry("plan")

agent = await build_agent(..., agent_pattern=graph)
```

### Per-Node Model Override

Use cheaper models for lightweight tasks, powerful models for complex reasoning:

```python
from promptise.engine import PromptNode, NodeFlag
from promptise.engine.reasoning_nodes import ThinkNode

graph = PromptGraph("cost-optimized", nodes=[
    # Cheap model for routing and simple analysis
    ThinkNode("think", model_override="openai:gpt-4o-mini"),

    # Main model for tool calling (uses build_agent's model)
    PromptNode("act", inject_tools=True),

    # Powerful model for final synthesis
    SynthesizeNode("answer", model_override="openai:gpt-4o", is_terminal=True),
])
```

### Node Flags

Control execution behavior with typed flags:

```python
from promptise.engine import PromptNode, NodeFlag

# Abort the entire graph if this node fails
PromptNode("critical_step", flags={NodeFlag.CRITICAL})

# Retry on failure with exponential backoff
PromptNode("flaky_api", flags={NodeFlag.RETRYABLE})

# Skip this node if the previous one errored
PromptNode("optional_enrichment", flags={NodeFlag.SKIP_ON_ERROR})

# Cache results — same inputs return cached output
PromptNode("expensive_analysis", flags={NodeFlag.CACHEABLE})

# Don't pass conversation history to this node
PromptNode("stateless_classifier", flags={NodeFlag.NO_HISTORY})

# Isolate context — node only sees its input_keys
PromptNode("isolated", flags={NodeFlag.ISOLATED_CONTEXT}, input_keys=["query"])
```

See [Node Flags](../engine-flags.md) for all 16 flags.

### Data Flow Between Nodes

```python
# Node A writes output to state
PromptNode("search", output_key="search_data", inject_tools=True)

# Node B reads specific keys from state
PromptNode("analyze", input_keys=["search_data"])

# Node B inherits the previous node's full output
PromptNode("analyze", inherit_context_from="search")
```

### Processors

Transform data before/after the LLM call:

```python
from promptise.engine.processors import (
    json_extractor, confidence_scorer,
    chain_postprocessors,
)

PromptNode("analyze",
    postprocessor=chain_postprocessors(
        json_extractor(keys=["answer", "confidence"]),
        confidence_scorer(),
    ),
)
```

See [Processors](../engine-processors.md) for all built-in processors.

## How It Integrates

When you pass `agent_pattern=` to `build_agent()`:

1. MCP tools are discovered from servers (as usual)
2. The graph is used instead of the default ReAct graph
3. Nodes with `inject_tools=True` receive the discovered tools
4. All other agent features work unchanged:
    - Memory injection (before graph execution)
    - Input/output guardrails (before/after graph execution)
    - Semantic cache (before/after graph execution)
    - Conversation persistence (`chat()` method)
    - Observability (callbacks propagated through graph)
    - Events and notifications
    - CallerContext per-request identity
